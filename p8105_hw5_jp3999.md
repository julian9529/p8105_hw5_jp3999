## Problem 1

Read data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide_data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

### Comment on differences between groups.

Overall the experiment arm seems to have increasing positive values, on
average, as the weeks progress. The Control arm on the other hand seems
to have decreasing or stable values as the weeks progress, half of the
observations seem to have negative values at some points.

## Problem 3

``` r
ttest = function(n=30, mu = 0, sd = 5) {
sample_data = tibble(
x = rnorm(n=30, mean = mu, sd = 5),
)
sample_data %>%
t.test() %>%
  broom::tidy()
}
```

Test ttest function

``` r
ttest_results = 
  rerun(5000, ttest(30, 0, 5))%>%
  bind_rows()
```

``` r
  mu = 
  list ( 
    "mu_0" = 0, 
    "mu_1" = 1, 
    "mu_2" = 2, 
    "mu_3" = 3, 
    "mu_4" = 4, 
    "mu_5" = 5,
    "mu_6" = 6 
    )

output_ttest = vector("list", length = 7)
for (i in 1:7) {
output_ttest[[i]] = rerun(5000, ttest(mu = mu[[i]])) %>%
bind_rows() 
}
```

``` r
data_plot1 = 
  bind_rows (output_ttest, .id = "mu")%>%
  select(mu, estimate, p.value) %>%
mutate (decision = case_when(p.value < 0.05 ~ "Reject", p.value >=0.05 ~ "Fail to Reject")) %>%
mutate(
mu = recode (mu, "1" = "0", "2" = "1", "3" = "2", "4" = "3","5" = "4","6" = "5",
"7" = "6")) 
```

``` r
data_plot1 %>%
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
n = n(),
power = sum(p.value < 0.05)/n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = power)) + geom_line() +geom_point() + labs(title = "proportion of times the null was rejected") 
```

    ## the group aesthetic?
